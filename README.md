# MachineLearningTraining
Description:
This repository holds some examples of machine learning that I am using to train myself with using Standford's online course on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). I am using MATLAB for most of my coding examples as it was the same language used in the course.

Contents:
In this repository, I have eight different examples that follow along the course outlined on Coursera. Each subdirectory has a README with specific insturctions on each example.
-ex1: (completed) univariate and multivariate linear regression using a cost function with gradient descent
-ex2: (incomplete)
-ex3: (incomplete)
-ex4: (incomplete)
-ex5: (incomplete)
-ex6: (incomplete)
-ex7: (incomplete)
-ex8: (incomplete)


My code:
All the files that I have updated myself will be found under the filename template "djshadle_<rest_of_filename>"
